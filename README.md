## Game Modes
PokeGames consists of several game modes:

In Classic mode, players are tasked with guessing the name of a randomly selected Pokémon. With each guess, hints are provided based on the Pokémon's characteristics such as type, habitat, color, evolution stage, height, and weight.

### Blurry Image
The Blurry Image mode challenges players to identify a Pokémon from a blurred image. As players make incorrect guesses, the image gradually becomes clearer.

### Zoomed-In Image
In this mode, players must guess the Pokémon from a highly zoomed-in image. Similar to the Blurry Image mode, the image zoom level is adjusted based on the number of incorrect guesses, gradually revealing more of the Pokémon.
